Welcome to RCareWorld's documentation!
===================================

**RCareWorld** is a human-centric simulation world for physical and social robot caregiving with support for realistic human modeling, home environments with multiple levels of accessibility, and robots used for assistance. This simulation is designed using inputs from stakeholders such as expert occupational therapists, care-recipients, and caregivers. It provides a variety of benchmark ADL tasks in realistic settings. It interfaces with various physics engines to model rigid, articulated and deformable objects. It provides the capability to plan, control, and learn both human and robot control policies by interfacing it with state-of-the-art external planning and learning libraries.
